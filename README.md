# PARTY IN THE SSH

## Official lyrics

So I put my hands down
I'm typing my code,
All the keyboards fly away
I'm noddin' my xterm like yeah
Movin' my IDE like yeah
I got my hands down,
I'm typin' my code
I know I'm gonna be OK
Yeah, it's a party in the SSH
Yeah, it's a party in the SSH

## HOW TO... Compile
Makefile.

## HOW TO... Party hard
Alcohol.

## HOW TO... Miley Cyrus
You really want to ?

## HOW TO...
That way.
